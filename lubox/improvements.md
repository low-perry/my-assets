I've completely restructured the Search API documentation to make it more scannable and consistent:

1. Clear Organization: Created a logical flow with main sections like Overview, Request Parameters, Response, and Best Practices.
2. Consistent Formatting: Used tables for parameters, code blocks for examples, and proper markdown headings for section hierarchy.
3. Visual Separation: Added clear headings and whitespace to improve scannability.
4. Parameter Grouping: Organized parameters into logical categories (required, optional, context) with consistent formatting.
5. Example Formatting: Standardized the way examples are presented throughout the document.
6. Concise Descriptions: Kept explanations clear and to the point, focusing on practical usage.
7. Best Practices: Highlighted important recommendations in their own section for easy reference.

This revised structure should make it much easier for developers to find the information they need quickly while maintaining a consistent style throughout.

## General improvements

1. Writing style guide to improve consistency
2. use tools like cspell or vale in the ci/cd pipeline
3. headers issue
4. callouts, notes, warnings style
5. better navigation
6. missing reference and or glossary
